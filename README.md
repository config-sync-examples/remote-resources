# remote-resources

This is a DRY (short for Don't Repeat Yourself) repository, which needs the hydration process to render the configs.

It includes a kustomization.yaml file, which only includes a remote resource.

You can manually run `kustomize` to preview the rendered manifests:
```console
mkdir manifests
kustomize build --output=manifests
```

You can also run `nomos hydrate` to preview the result:
```console
nomos hydrate --source-format=unstructured --output=manifests
```

To validate the hydrated configs, run:
```console
nomos vet --source-format=unstructured
```

You can save the hydrated output in the validation process via `--keep-output`:
```console
nomos vet --source-format=unstructured --keep-output --output=manifests
```
